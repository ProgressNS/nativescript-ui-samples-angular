Content Management System and/or component vendors are not allowed to use the
Software (as defined below) without the express permission of Telerik. If You or
the company You represent is a Content Management System and/or component
vendor, You may not purchase a license for or use the Software unless You
contact Telerik directly and obtain permission. 

 

This is a license agreement and not an agreement for sale. 

\*\*1. Definitions\*\*

 

For purposes of this Agreement: 

 

“Integrated Products” means Your proprietary software applications which: (i)
are developed by Your Licensed Developers; (ii) add substantial functionality
beyond the functionality provided by the incorporated components of the
Programs; and (iii) are not commercial alternatives for, or competitive in the
marketplace with, the Programs or any components of the Programs. 

 

“Licensed Developers” means Your employees or third-party contractors authorized
to develop software specifically for You using the Software in accordance with
this Agreement. 

 

\*\* \*\*

 

\*\*2. Software License\*\* 

\*\*2.1 License Grant.\*\* Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Telerik hereby grants to Licensee and Licensee hereby accepts, a
limited, non-transferable, perpetual, sublicenseable (solely as set forth in
Section 2.3), non-exclusive license (the “License”) to use the Telerik computer
software identified as UI for NativeScript and any updates, upgrades,
modifications and error corrections thereto provided to Licensee (the
“Programs”) and any accompanying documentation (the “Documentation”, together
with the Programs, collectively the “Software”) solely as specified in this
Agreement. You are granted either a Trial Developer License pursuant to Section
2.4 or a Professional Developer License with Updates and Priority Support
pursuant to Section 2.5. Which version of the License applies (i.e., Trial
Developer License or Professional Developer License with Updates and Priority
Support) is determined at the time of the License purchase. The Software may
contain certain components that require access to the Telerik Platform to be
fully functional. This Agreement does not grant You a license to use the Telerik
Platform; You must obtain such license separately.   

\*\*2.2 Scope of Use.\*\* The Software is licensed, not sold, on a per-seat
basis. The number of Licensed Developers using the Software must correspond to
the maximum number of License seats You have purchased from Telerik hereunder.
This means that, at any given time, the number of Licensed Developers cannot
exceed the number of License seats that You have purchased from Telerik and for
which You have paid Telerik all applicable License Fees pursuant to this
Agreement. The Software is in “use” on a computer when it is loaded into
temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk
or other storage device). Your Licensed Developers may install the Software on
multiple machines, so long as the Software is not being used simultaneously for
development purposes at any given time by more Licensed Developers than You have
License seats. You are not limited by the number of License seats with respect
to how many individuals within Your organization may access and use the Software
for testing and building purposes. You may also embed copies of the Programs in
Your Integrated Products that You license and distribute to Your own end-user
licensees, including but not limited to, Your employees (“Authorized
End-Users”), solely in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 2.3
below. 

\*\*2.3 License for Redistribution\*\* 

\*\*2.3.1 License Grant. \*\*Subject to the terms of this Agreement, You are
granted a limited, nontransferable, royalty-free license to redistribute and
sublicense the use of the Programs solely to Authorized End-Users: (i) in object
code form only; (ii) as embedded within Your Integrated Product for internal
company use, hosted applications, websites, commercial solutions deployed at
Your Authorized End Users sites, or shrink- or click-wrapped software solutions;
and (iii) pursuant to an end user license agreement or terms of use that:
imposes the limitations set forth in this paragraph on Your Authorized
End-Users; prohibits distribution of the Programs by Your Authorized End-Users;
limits the liability of Your licensors or suppliers to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law; and prohibits any attempt to disassemble the code,
or attempt in any manner to reconstruct, discover, reuse or modify any source
code or underlying algorithms of the Programs, except to the limited extent as
is permitted by law notwithstanding contractual prohibition.  Notwithstanding
subsection 2.3.1(iii), if Your Integrated Product is only distributed to Your
employees for internal use, You are not required to distribute Your Integrated
Product pursuant to an end user license agreement or terms of use. In no event
are You allowed to distribute the Software or sublicense its use (a) in any
format other than in object form, (b) as a standalone product or (c) as a part
of any product other than Your Integrated Product. 

\*\*2.3.2\*\* The foregoing license to redistribute the Programs is conditioned
upon the following: 

\*\*2.3.2.1\*\* You hereby acknowledge and agree that You are solely responsible
for Your Authorized End-User’s use of the Programs in accordance with the
limitations set forth in subsection 2.3.1(iii) and liable for such Authorized
End-User’s breach of such limitations, even if You are not required to
distribute an end user license agreement or terms of use under subsection
2.3.1(iii).  

\*\*2.3.2.2\*\* You must ensure that the Software is not distributed in any form
that allows it to be reused by any application other than Your Integrated
Product. If You have any questions regarding redistribution, please
contact [support\@telerik.com](mailto:support\@telerik.com%22%20%5Ct%20%22blank).
For use of the Software in design-time (i.e. within a development environment)
Your Authorized End-Users need to purchase Developer Licenses from Telerik. 

\*\*2.3.2.3\*\* You must prohibit Your Authorized End-Users from using the
Software independently from Your Integrated Products, or from decompiling,
reverse engineering or otherwise seeking to discover the source code of the
Programs.  

\*\*

2.3.2.4 \*\*You must include a valid copyright message in Your Integrated
Products in a location viewable by Authorized End-Users (e.g. “About” box) that
will serve to protect Telerik’s copyright and other intellectual property rights
in the Software.  

\*\*2.3.2.5\*\* You are not allowed to, and are expressly prohibited from
granting Your Authorized End-Users any right to further sublicense the
Software.

\*\*7. Intellectual Property\*\* 

 

All title and ownership rights in and to the Software (including but not limited
to any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, or text embedded in
the Software), the intellectual property embodied in the Software, and any
trademarks or service marks of Telerik that are used in connection with the

content owner and may be protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual
property laws and treaties. This Agreement grants You no rights to use such
content. This Software may contain or be accompanies by certain third party
components which are subject to additional restriction.  These components, if
any, are identified in, and subject to, special license terms and conditions set
forth in the “readme.txt” file, the “notices.txt” file, or the “Third Party
Software” file accompanying the Software (“Special Notices”). The Special
Notices include important licensing and warranty information and disclaimers. In
the event of a conflict between the Special Notices and the other portions of
this Agreement, the Special Notices will take precedence (but solely with
respect to the third party component(s) to which the Special Notice relates).
Any open source software that may be delivered by Telerik embedded in or in
association with Telerik products is provided pursuant to the open source
license applicable to the software and subject to the disclaimers and
limitations on liability set forth in such license.  

\*\*8. Collection and Use of Data\*\* 

 

Telerik uses tools to deliver certain Software features and extensions, identify
trends and bugs, collect activation information, usage statistics and track
other data related to Your use of the Software as further described in the most
current version of Telerik’s Privacy Policy (located at:
http://www.telerik.com/company/privacy-policy). By Your acceptance of the terms
of this Agreement and/or use of the Software, You authorize the collection, use
and disclosure of this data for the purposes provided for in this Agreement
and/or the Privacy Policy. 

\*\*9. Limited Warranty\*\* 

 

Except as specified in Section 2.4.4 (Trial License), Telerik warrants solely
that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying
written materials for a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which You
purchase the License for the Software. Telerik does not warrant the use of the
Software will be uninterrupted or error free at all times and in all
circumstances, nor that program errors will be corrected. This limited warranty
shall not apply to any error or failure resulting from (i) machine error, (ii)
Licensee’s failure to follow operating instructions, (iii) negligence or
accident, or (iv) modifications to the Software by any person or entity other
than Telerik. In the event of a breach of warranty, Licensee’s sole and
exclusive remedy and Telerik’s sole and exclusive obligation, is repair of all
or any portion of the Software. If such remedy fails of its essential purpose,
Licensee’s sole remedy and Telerik’s maximum liability shall be a refund of the
paid purchase price for the defective Software only. This limited warranty is
only valid if Telerik receives written notice of breach of warranty no later
than thirty (30) days after the warranty period expires. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS
WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9, TELERIK DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 

\*\*10. Limitation of Liability\*\* 

 

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Telerik be
liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising
out of this Agreement, including, without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility thereof, and
regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon
which the claim is based. In any case, Telerik’s entire liability under any
provision of this Agreement shall not exceed in the aggregate the sum of the
license fees Licensee paid to Telerik for the Software giving rise to such
damages, or in the case of a Trial License, shall not exceed \$5,
notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not be applicable.
Telerik is not responsible for any liability arising out of content provided by
Licensee or a third party that is accessed through the Software and/or any
material linked through such content. Any data included in the Software upon
shipment from Telerik is for testing use only and Telerik hereby disclaims any
and all liability arising therefrom. The extent of Telerik’s liability for the
limited warranty section shall be as set forth therein. 

\*\*11. Indemnity\*\* 

 

You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Telerik and its resellers from
and against any and all claims, lawsuits and proceedings (collectively
“Claims”), and all expenses, costs (including attorney's fees), judgments,
damages and other liabilities resulting from such Claims, that arise or result
from (i) Your use of the Software in violation of this Agreement, (ii) the use
or distribution of Your Integrated Product or (iii) Your modification of the
Program’s source code. 

\*\*12. Confidentiality\*\* 

 

Except as otherwise provided herein, each party expressly undertakes to retain
in confidence all information and know-how transmitted or disclosed to the other
that the disclosing party has identified as being proprietary and/or
confidential or that, by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the
disclosure, ought in good faith to be treated as proprietary and/or
confidential, and expressly undertakes to make no use of such information and
know-how except under the terms and during the existence of this Agreement.
However, neither party shall have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality
of information that: (i) it received rightfully from a third party without an
obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (ii) the disclosing party
has disclosed to a third party without any obligation to maintain such
information in confidence; (iii) was known to the receiving party prior to its
disclosure by the disclosing party; or (iv) is independently developed by the
receiving party without use of the confidential information of the disclosing
party. Further, either party may disclose confidential information of the other
party as required by governmental or judicial order, provided such party gives
the other party prompt written notice prior to such disclosure and complies with
any protective order (or equivalent) imposed on such disclosure. Without
limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall treat any source code for the Programs as
confidential information and shall not disclose, disseminate or distribute such
materials to any third party without Telerik’s prior written permission. Each
party’s obligations under this Section 12 shall apply at all times during the
term of this Agreement and for five (5) years following termination of this
Agreement, provided, however, that (i) obligations with respect to source code
shall survive in perpetuity and (ii) trade secrets shall be maintained as such
until they fall into the public domain. 

\*\*

13. Governing Law\*\* 

 

This License will be governed by the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
U.S.A., without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. If any
dispute, controversy, or claim cannot be resolved by a good faith discussion
between the parties, then it shall be submitted for resolution to a state or
Federal court or competent jurisdiction in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, and the
parties hereby agree to submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court. The
Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act and the United Nations Convention
on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. Failure of
a party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute or be
construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce such
provision. 

\*\*14. Entire Agreement\*\* 

 

This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous communications regarding the subject matter hereof. Use of any
purchase order or other Licensee document in connection herewith shall be for
administrative convenience only and all terms and conditions stated therein
shall be void and of no effect unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both
parties. In cases where this license is being obtained through an approved third
party, these terms shall supersede any third party license or purchase
agreement. 

\*\*15. No Assignment\*\* 

 

You may not assign, sublicense, sub-contract, or otherwise transfer this
Agreement, or any rights or obligations under it, without Telerik’s prior
written consent. 

\*\*16. Survival\*\* 

 

Any provisions of the Agreement containing license restrictions, including but
not limited to those related to the Program source code, warranties and warranty
disclaimers, confidentiality obligations, limitations of liability and/or
indemnity terms, and any provision of the Agreement which, by its nature, is
intended to survive shall remain in effect following any termination or
expiration of the Agreement. 

\*\*17. Severability\*\* 

 

If a particular provision of this Agreement is terminated or held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions.  

\*\*18. Force Majeure\*\* 

 

Neither party shall be deemed in default of this Agreement if failure or delay
in performance is caused by an act of God, fire, flood, severe weather
conditions, material shortage or unavailability of transportation, government
ordinance, laws, regulations or restrictions, war or civil disorder, or any
other cause beyond the reasonable control of such party. 

\*\*19. Export Classifications\*\* 

 

You expressly agree not to export or re-export Telerik Software or Your
Integrated Product to any country, person, entity or end user subject to U.S.
export restrictions. You specifically agree not to export, re-export, or
transfer the Software to any country to which the U.S. has embargoed or
restricted the export of goods or services, or to any national of any such
country, wherever located, who intends to transmit or transport the products
back to such country, or to any person or entity who has been prohibited from
participating in U.S. export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S.
government. You warrant and represent that neither the U.S.A. Bureau of Industry
and Security nor any other federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied Your
export privileges.
